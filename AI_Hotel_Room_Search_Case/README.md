AI Hotel Room Search System

Objective: Design a visual hotel room search system.

What I Did:
- Used GPT-4 Vision to generate image captions for 15 hotel room images.
- Extracted room features: type, view, balcony, desk, AC, capacity.
- Converted natural language queries into filterable attributes.
- Implemented rule-based & semantic matching to return relevant image URLs.
- Simulated a modular agent-based architecture: Image Analysis, Query Parsing, Matching Agent.

Technologies: Python, Pandas, GPT-4V

Deliverables: Image matching results & system flow documentation.
